trame-vtk extend trame **widgets** with components that can interface with VTK and/or ParaView.

VTK integration in trame allows you to create rich visualization and data processing applications by leveraging the Python wrapping of the VTK library.
Several components are available so you can leverage VTK either for its data processing and/or rendering.
trame lets you choose if you want to leverage Remote Rendering or if the client should do the rendering by leveraging vtk.js under the hood.

Trame widgets
-----------------------------------------------------------

VtkRemoteView
-----------------------------------------------------------

The VtkRemoteView component relies on the server for rendering by sending images to the client by simply binding your vtkRenderWindow to it.
This component gives you controls to the image size reduction and quality to reduce latency while interacting.


How to use it?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The component allows you to directly tap into a vtk.js interactor's events so you can bind your own method from Python to them.
The list of available events can be found `here <https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js/blob/b92ad5463150b88514fcb5020c1fa6c7fcfe2a4f/Sources/Rendering/Core/RenderWindowInteractor/index.js#L23-L60>`_.

The component also provides a convenient method for pushing a new image to the client when you're modifying your scene on the Python side.

.. code-block:: python

    from trame.widgets import vtk

    def end():
        pass

    remote_view = vtk.vtkRemoteView(
        view=...,               # Instance of vtkRenderWindow (required)
        ref=...,                # Identifier for this component
        interactive_quality=60, # [0, 100] 0 for fastest render, 100 for best quality
        interactive_ratio=...,  # [0.1, 1] Image size scale factor while interacting
        interactor_events=(     # Enable vtk.js interactor events for method binding
            "events",
            ["EndAnimation"],
        ),
        EndAnimation=end,       # Bind method to the enabled event
    )

    remote_view.update()  # Force image to be pushed to client

VtkLocalView
-----------------------------------------------------------

The VtkLocalView component relies on the server for defining the vtkRenderWindow but then only the geometry is exchanged with the client.
The server does not need a GPU as no rendering is happening on the server.
The vtkRenderWindow is only used to retrieve the scene data and parameters (coloring by, representations, ...).
By relying on the same vtkRenderWindow, you can easily switch from a `VtkRemoteView` to a `VtkLocalView` or vice-versa.
This component gives you controls on how you want to map mouse interaction with the camera.
The default setting mimic default VTK interactor style so you will rarely have to override to the `interactor_settings`.

The component allows you to directly tap into a vtk.js interactor events so you can bind your own method from python to them.
The list of available events can be found `here <https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js/blob/b92ad5463150b88514fcb5020c1fa6c7fcfe2a4f/Sources/Rendering/Core/RenderWindowInteractor/index.js#L23-L60>`_.

The component also provides a convenient method to push the scene to the client when you're modifying your scene on the python side.

.. code-block:: python

    from trame.widgets import vtk

    def end():
        pass

    local_view = vtk.VtkLocalView(
        view=...,                # Instance of vtkRenderWindow (required)
        ref=...,                 # Identifier for this component
        context_name=...,        # Namespace for geometry cache
        interactor_settings=..., # Options for camera controls. See below.
        interactor_events=(      # Enable vtk.js interactor events for method binding
            "events",
            ['EndAnimation'],
        ),
        EndAnimation=end,        # Bind method to the enabled event
    )

    local_view.update()  # Force geometry to be pushed



Interactor Settings
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

For the `interactor_settings` we expect a list of mouse event type linked to an action. The example below is what is used as default:

.. code-block:: javascript

    interactor_settings=[
      {
        button: 1,
        action: 'Rotate',
      }, {
        button: 2,
        action: 'Pan',
      }, {
        button: 3,
        action: 'Zoom',
        scrollEnabled: true,
      }, {
        button: 1,
        action: 'Pan',
        shift: true,
      }, {
        button: 1,
        action: 'Zoom',
        alt: true,
      }, {
        button: 1,
        action: 'ZoomToMouse',
        control: true,
      }, {
        button: 1,
        action: 'Roll',
        alt: true,
        shift: true,
      }
    ]

A mouse event can be identified with the following set of properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Value
     - Description
   * - button
     - 1, 2, 3
     - Which button should be down
   * - shift
     - true/false
     - Is the Shift key down
   * - alt
     - true/false
     - Is the Alt key down
   * - control
     - true/false
     - Is the Ctrl key down
   * - scrollEnabled
     - true/false
     - Some action could also be triggered by scroll
   * - dragEnabled
     - true/false
     - Mostly used to disable default drag behavior

And the action could be one of the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Action
     - Description
   * - Pan
     - Will pan the object on the plane normal to the camera
   * - Zoom
     - Will zoom closer or further from the object based on the drag direction
   * - Roll
     - Will rotate the object around the view direction
   * - ZoomToMouse
     - Will zoom while keeping the location that was initially under the mouse at the same spot

VtkRemoteLocalView
-----------------------------------------------------------

The VtkRemoteLocalView component is a blend of `VtkLocalView` and `VtkRemoteView` where the user can choose dynamically which mode they want to be in.
When instantiating a `VtkRemoteLocalView` several variables and triggers will be created for you to more easily control your view.

How to use it?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: python

    from trame.html import vtk

    rl_view = vtk.VtkRemoteLocalView(
        view=...,                # Instance of vtkRenderWindow (required)

        # Just VtkRemoteLocalView params
        namespace=...,           # Prefix for variables and triggers. See below. (required)
        mode="local",            # Decide between local or remote. See below.

        # VtkRemoteView params
        **remote_view_params,

        # VtkLocalView params
        **local_view_params,
    )

    rl_view.update_geometry()  # Force update to geometry
    rl_view.update_image()     # Force update to image
    rl_view.view()             # Get linked vtkRenderWindow instance


Namespace parameter
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Constructing a VtkRemoteLocalView will set several variables, prefixed by a namespace. In the example below we used `namespace="view"`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - viewId
     - `str` representing the vtkRenderWindow id
   * - viewMode
     - `local`or `remote` to control which View is displayed to the user

Constructing a VtkRemoteLocalView will also set several trame triggers.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Trigger
     - Description
   * - viewCamera
     - When call with no arguments, the server will push its camera to the client
   * - viewAnimateStart
     - Start the animation loop for constantly rendering
   * - viewAnimateStop
     - Stop the animation loop

The `namespace` will also be used as `ref=` unless provided by the user.

Mode parameter
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The mode is driven by the variable `{namespace}Mode` but can be provided when instantiated so the default can be overridden and a JavaScript expression can be used instead of the default variable. This attribute behaves the same way as any trame one except, we won't register the left side as a state entry since we already have one under `{namespace}Mode`. This means we will evaluate the left side of the expression assuming a tuple is provided and the right side of the tuple is used to set its initial value.
